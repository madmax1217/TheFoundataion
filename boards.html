    <header style="font-size:200%">Robotics and Embedded Systems Course Objectives</header><!--This header acts as the visible title for my page, I added inline CSS to make it stand out more with the style tag-->
    
    <p>1. Design and complete robotic and embedded systems solutions that address real-world situations and challenges.</p><!--I seperated each line as it's own paragraph for a better visual on the page-->
    <p>2. Demonstrate embedded microprocessor system skills such as microcontroller selection, digital logic design, schematic<!--I could even change the color of each line with inline CSS if I would like-->
        creation, printed circuit board layout and construction, electromagnetic compatibility design and manufacturing design.</p><!--For now, I believe this is enough seperation to add a nice flow to my page-->
    <p>3. Develop vision and sensing systems for use in robotic applications.</p><!--More paragraphs, these containers are very generic, but for the first assignment that is A OK-->
    <p>4. Integrate transducers, actuators, feedback and other mechanical systems into robotic platforms.</p><!--I like using the p tag to seperate things out without making them complicated.-->
    <p>5. Apply examples of human and autonomous control systems into robotic platforms.</p><!--Had I not seperated these, they would have just been more mashed together, this is strictly for looks-->
    <p>6. Implement artificial intelligence and data systems into robotic platforms.</p><!--I am excited to use more tags as wella s getting into CSS next week-->
